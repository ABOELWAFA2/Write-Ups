Hello guys, hope you all are doing well, This is my second writeup on medium, I’m Ahmed Kamal a Security Researcher and bug bounty hunter from Egypt.
In this writeup, I am going to talk about a Reflected XSS Vulnerability on a VDP on my lovely platform bugcrowd , But Due to the company’s policy I can’t reveal the name of the target let’s say example.com
I am sharing with you my first Reflected XSS finding, which I’ve found 1 month ago, which unfortunately got duplicated but no problem I’ll share the steps of the finding.
Below are the tools that I use in testing xss but in this bug, i didn’t use all of them because the Rxss was in the search box on the home page so didn’t need to collect parameters for the domain.

Tools:
Paramspider:- https://github.com/devanshbatham/ParamSpider
Gxss:- https://github.com/KathanP19/Gxss
kxss:- https://github.com/Emoe/kxss
xsstrike:- https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike

First, i entered a random string on the search box to see what’ll happen
https://subdomain.example.com/search?q=test
then I saw that the word was reflected on the page

you can automate this step using Gxss “which checks a bunch of URLs that contain reflecting params” with the command below :
echo “https://subdomain.example.com/search?q=test" | Gxss
which indicated that the value of the q parameter gets reflected in the page.

let’s move to the next step where we want to know the appropriate payload for exploitation
this step contains two processes, first, find the unfiltered parameter then find the perfect payload for that
usually, i automate this whole process using kxss and XSStrike as shown below:-
echo “https://www.kayenta.bie.edu/sys/search?q=test" | kxss
the result was something like this:-
URL: https://www.kayenta.bie.edu/sys/search?q=test Param: q Unfiltered: [ ' < > $ | ` : ; ]

then moved to xsstrike with the command below:
python3 xsstrike.py -d https://www.kayenta.bie.edu/sys/search?q=test
well, it's completed and the final payload looked like this:
https://www.kayenta.bie.edu/sys/search?q=%3Chtml%0aonmouseOver%0a=%0a(prompt)``//

when i tested it in the browser it worked successfully and prompt box arised, then i reported it and got duplicated…
